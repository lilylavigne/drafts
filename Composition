Composition 
This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The minimum length of your composition should be in the neighborhood of 2,000 words. You may write more than 2,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum. 
Your composition should be a nonfiction narrative on any topic you choose (your readings will be from many genres, but your writing will be nonfiction). The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity. This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; I won’t assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. To ease your anxiety about topics, here is a short list of possibilities: 
A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 
A narrative about an aspect of your inner life (for example, your relationship to your own creativity, or your struggle with procrastination) 
A narrative about a particular subject of deep interest to you (for example, the mythologies of Egypt, or your passion for cooking) 
A collection of poems on a specific theme (for example, nature) 
You only need to choose one topic, and you should choose it within the first two weeks of the course. Then start writing about it (see below for how and where to do that). As a companion list to the one above, here is a short list of topics that I do not wish you to write about: 
Video games 
Zombies (or other post-apocalyptic themes) 
Movies, Manga, comics, or popular culture in general 
Trauma (your own personal trauma) 
Any subject that is challenging for you to talk about openly (such as trauma) is a subject you should not write about. On the other hand, powerful personal experiences (including traumas) are often the best subject for creativity, so please use your judgment in deciding how best to be expressive while at the same being emotionally safe. If you’re not sure, ask. 
If you want highly specific examples of the kinds of subjects you might write about, read the main course text, Grain of Truth, as well as the posts on the course website (you’re doing that anyway, right?).

A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 

EXAMPLE 1:Travelling/Sailboat experience/ pirates/ venice/ etc.

I do not remeber my surrondings, who I was with, where I was with, what I was doing. 
The moment I was born was also the moment my life would be filled with 

Coming from a smalltown in Vietnam, my parents had one dream and that dream was to sail around the world. After six months old, away we left. It was my brother, mom, dad and myself.
As I cannot remember that much because I was so young, the times that I do remember when I was yearing around 4 and 5 were the most meaningful experiences in life. I learned a lot of life lessons and lessons about helping to work with my family on a boat.

Volunteering is important to me. I have always done small volunteer projects since elementary school. I helped with public events, sports, recreation, arts, crafts, animal shelters, kids. 

But, ever since high school I realized that I want to relate my personality, skills and career goals towards health and social services. 

My last few years of high school, my grandpa began to show symptons of dementia. The early stage, memory loss. The middle stage, personality change, mood changes, confusion. The final stage and last stage, everything being sevre.

Every chance I had, I travelled to the Sunshine Coast from New Westminster by transit to visit my grandaparents.  

It is now my last year of high school. I took time off to live with my grandma and grandpa. I do extra school work from my teachers. My grandpa is now 80 years old. 

I spend days with my grandpa. I watch my grandpa's movements from getting up and down from his chair. At times, I see my grandma and grandpa argue about simple things, for example if he is hungry. Temper is short. I listen to him talk. I listen to his stories. He chuckles. I smile with happiness and sadness. I start to notice the changes in his behaviour compared to when I was a little girl. Mainly in his language and communication. His attentative focus was no longer there. I watch my family, especifically my grandma take care of my grandpa. I notice his legs became smaller and weaker and the phsyical, mental toll it took on my grandma. The process of dementia was slow yet fast. I realize the importance of caring for our elders and appreciating them. I realize the beauty in people and their actions. 


Later on, I found myself volunteering at BC Childrends Hospital and The Salvation Army, Buchanan Lodge through Fraser Health. The BCCH specializes in health care for patients from birth to age 16. The Buchanan Lodge is a home that provides care to adults who can not physically take care of themselves. My thoughts explore both the different facilities and experience with health care of all ages. 

Both, which gave me an important lesson and realization for others who needed a little bit of extra speical care.
