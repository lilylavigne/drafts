Composition 
This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The minimum length of your composition should be in the neighborhood of 2,000 words. You may write more than 2,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum. 
Your composition should be a nonfiction narrative on any topic you choose (your readings will be from many genres, but your writing will be nonfiction). The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity. This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; I won’t assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. To ease your anxiety about topics, here is a short list of possibilities: 
A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 
A narrative about an aspect of your inner life (for example, your relationship to your own creativity, or your struggle with procrastination) 
A narrative about a particular subject of deep interest to you (for example, the mythologies of Egypt, or your passion for cooking) 
A collection of poems on a specific theme (for example, nature) 
You only need to choose one topic, and you should choose it within the first two weeks of the course. Then start writing about it (see below for how and where to do that). As a companion list to the one above, here is a short list of topics that I do not wish you to write about: 
Video games 
Zombies (or other post-apocalyptic themes) 
Movies, Manga, comics, or popular culture in general 
Trauma (your own personal trauma) 
Any subject that is challenging for you to talk about openly (such as trauma) is a subject you should not write about. On the other hand, powerful personal experiences (including traumas) are often the best subject for creativity, so please use your judgment in deciding how best to be expressive while at the same being emotionally safe. If you’re not sure, ask. 
If you want highly specific examples of the kinds of subjects you might write about, read the main course text, Grain of Truth, as well as the posts on the course website (you’re doing that anyway, right?).

A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 

EXAMPLE 1:Travelling/Sailboat experience/ pirates/ venice/ etc.

I do not remeber my surrondings, who I was with, where I was with, what I was doing. 
The moment I was born was also the moment my life would be filled with 

Coming from a smalltown in Vietnam, my parents had one dream and that dream was to sail around the world. After six months old, away we left. It was my brother, mom, dad and myself.
As I cannot remember that much because I was so young, the times that I do remember when I was yearing around 4 and 5 were the most meaningful experiences in life. I learned a lot of life lessons and lessons about helping to work with my family on a boat.

Volunteering is important to me. I have always done small volunteer projects since elementary school. I helped with public events, sports, recreation, arts, crafts, animal shelters, kids. 

But, ever since high school I realized that I want to relate my personality, skills and career goals towards health and social services. 

Family is important to me. Especially my grandparents. A majority of my childhood was spent at their house. My grandma is courageous, tough, and a caring woman, while my grandpa is a loud, loving, outgoing man. 

My last few years of high school, my grandpa began to show symptons of dementia. The early stage, memory loss. The middle stage, personality change, mood changes, confusion. The final stage and last stage, everything being sevre.

Every chance I had, I travelled to the Sunshine Coast from New Westminster, BC by transit to visit my grandaparents.  

It is now my last year of high school. I took time off to live with my grandma and grandpa. I do extra school work from my teachers. My grandpa is now 80 years old. 

I spend every day with my grandpa. I take a picture with him every day, it makes him smile. I watch my grandpa's movements from getting up and down from his chair. At times, I see my grandma and grandpa argue about simple things, for example if he is hungry. Temper is short. I listen to him talk. He repeats what he just said, but I understand. I listen to his stories to when he was young. He chuckles. I smile with happiness and sadness. I start to notice the changes in his behaviour compared to when I was a little girl. Mainly in his language and communication. His attentative focus was no longer there. He became quiet and a blank stare would gaze over his eyes. 

I watch my family, especifically my grandma take care of my grandpa. I first notice his legs became smaller and weaker, then his upper body became more fragile. I could see the phsyical and mental toll it took on my grandma. I am worried about her. I do everything I can to help my grandma and grandpa.
I overhear a conversation from the dining room. The consideration of putting my grandpa in a care home, but it did not happen. The process of dementia was slow yet fast. Through the tough times, good and bad. I realize the importance of caring for our elders and appreciating them. 

Later on, I find myself volunteering at two different facilities because of my grandpa and grandma. I want to share my profound passion of caring for people towards others. As well as what I learned from my grandfatheres dementia, so I can share that experience and relate it to people struggling with the same disease themselves or different families that do not understand what it is like. Besides from my career goals in a health care setting, what is a better way than doing that through volunteering. 

The quality time I spent with my grandpa made me want to give some of my time to others who do not have a family to give them company that they deserve. 

My thoughts - explore two different types of facilities to experience health care of all ages. 

I love to work with children. I apply at a BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver. I have never worked with adults/elders in a health care setting. I apply at The Salvation Army, Buchanan Lodge through Fraser Health in New Wesminster. The BCCH specializes in health care for patients from birth to age 16. The Buchanan Lodge is a home that provides care to adults who can not physically take care of themselves. 

Both, which give me an important lesson and realization for others who need a little bit of extra speical care. 

At BCCH, I help with charity events and play with children. I try my best to make a positive environment for everyone, including staff. I walk into the hospital, go floor to floor. I carefully analyze my surroundings around me. I reflect on the sight of sad faces on multiple children and fear in their parents eyes. I think to myself, having a child in the hospital is not only stressful to the child but parent too. Let us not forget, there are happy children and families too. Espeically on floor three, where newborns are held. The excitment I see from new and experienced moms and dads is one of the best sights to see. I feel touched and captivated.



It is summer time. I struggle with the feeling of not wanting to volunteer today. It can be hard to find the time out of my day, but I remember the benefits I have. I built a lot of warm friendships whom I connect with. I walk with them, wheel-chair them around the place. I listen to them talk, just like I did with my grandpa. They are happy to see me. That makes me smile. I even met other volunteers and built a friendship with them too.

I leave my house, it is a beauitful sunny day. I walk for five minutes down the hill, then turn left to the Buchanan Lodge. I press the security buttons to enter through the main door, sign in, and the receptionsist greets me. I walk to the elevator to go upstairs to meet someone special to my heart.

I built a relationship with a lady named Marley who I visit frequently. First I walk to her room, then wheel Marley outside to the gardens, the feel of warm sun on our skin is endearing, the smell of the garden's peonies and lilacs fill the air at the bench we sit at. She talks for hours about her life experiences and joy she has for baking delicious cakes and pastries. I can almost smell the cinnamon lingering in the air from her apple pie she chat about. I can not forget that she is born in the year of 1942, which she tells me repeatedly. 



I feel satisfied with myself and accomplished. I learned things about myself, inhanced my social skills and learned interesting facts, ideas, aspirations from the patients too. I consider others opinions more now. Others should consider volunteering too. It is an experience and feeling that can not be replaced. It is also a productive way to spend time. 

I spend numerous hours at the facility. I am happy to be here and give my time to our community and the people who were once my age. I assist activity programs,such as bingo, ice cream days, bake sales, lunch and dinner parties, escort residents,
