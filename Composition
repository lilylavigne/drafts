Composition 
This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The minimum length of your composition should be in the neighborhood of 2,000 words. You may write more than 2,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum. 
Your composition should be a nonfiction narrative on any topic you choose (your readings will be from many genres, but your writing will be nonfiction). The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity. This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; I won’t assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. To ease your anxiety about topics, here is a short list of possibilities: 
A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 
A narrative about an aspect of your inner life (for example, your relationship to your own creativity, or your struggle with procrastination) 
A narrative about a particular subject of deep interest to you (for example, the mythologies of Egypt, or your passion for cooking) 
A collection of poems on a specific theme (for example, nature) 
You only need to choose one topic, and you should choose it within the first two weeks of the course. Then start writing about it (see below for how and where to do that). As a companion list to the one above, here is a short list of topics that I do not wish you to write about: 
Video games 
Zombies (or other post-apocalyptic themes) 
Movies, Manga, comics, or popular culture in general 
Trauma (your own personal trauma) 
Any subject that is challenging for you to talk about openly (such as trauma) is a subject you should not write about. On the other hand, powerful personal experiences (including traumas) are often the best subject for creativity, so please use your judgment in deciding how best to be expressive while at the same being emotionally safe. If you’re not sure, ask. 
If you want highly specific examples of the kinds of subjects you might write about, read the main course text, Grain of Truth, as well as the posts on the course website (you’re doing that anyway, right?).

Pick any object, animal, plant, or other thing, and give it a meaning.

A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 

EXAMPLE 1:Travelling/Sailboat experience/ pirates/ venice/ etc.

I do not remeber my surrondings, who I was with, where I was with, what I was doing. 
The moment I was born was also the moment my life would be filled with 

Coming from a smalltown in Vietnam, my parents had one dream and that dream was to sail around the world. After six months old, away we left. It was my brother, mom, dad and myself.
As I cannot remember that much because I was so young, the times that I do remember when I was yearing around 4 and 5 were the most meaningful experiences in life. I learned a lot of life lessons and lessons about helping to work with my family on a boat.

Volunteering is important to me. I have always done small volunteer projects since elementary school. I helped with public events, sports, recreation, arts, crafts, animal shelters, kids. 

But, ever since high school I realized that I want to relate my personality, skills and career goals towards health and social services. 

Family is important to me. Especially my grandparents. A majority of my childhood was spent at their house. My grandma is courageous, tough, and a caring woman, while my grandpa is a loud, loving, outgoing man. 

My last few years of high school, my grandpa began to show symptons of dementia. The early stage, memory loss. The middle stage, personality change, mood changes, confusion. The final stage and last stage, everything being sevre.

Every chance I had, I travelled to the Sunshine Coast from New Westminster, BC by transit to visit my grandaparents. I walk 10 minutes down the hill to the skytrain station, take the skytrain approximately 26 minutes to Stadium Station, walk a few minutes to the 257 express bus to Horseshoe Bay terminal to catch the ferry to Langdale. I buy my ticket from the teller and walk to the waiting room. The first thing I like to do on the ferry is get water and sit on the seats, front of the vessel. The ferry ride is about a 45 minute wait. I used to think it took a long time, but now that I am older the wait time of the ferry speeds by.

It is now my last year of high school, grade 12. I took time off to live with my grandma and grandpa. I do extra school work from my teachers and still manage to graduate with my classmates on time. My grandpa is now 80 years old. 

I spend every day with him. I take a picture with him every day, it makes him smile. I watch my grandpa's movements from getting up and down from his chair. At times, I see my grandma and grandpa argue about simple things, for example if he is hungry. Temper is short. Time is limited. I listen to him talk. He repeats what he just said, but I understand. I listen to his stories to when he was young. He likes to talk about his old work life and the trouble he used to get into with his best friends. He chuckles. I smile with happiness, yet sadness. I start to notice the changes in his behaviour compared to when I was a little girl. Mainly in his language and communication. Overtime, his attentative focus was no longer there. He became quiet and a blank stare would gaze over his eyes. 

I watch my family, especifically my grandma take care of my grandpa. I first notice his legs became smaller and weaker, then his upper body became more fragile. His large sized t-shirts became baggy. His favourite red plaid pajama pants were too big. I could see the physical and mental toll it took on my grandma. I am worried about her. I attempt to do everything I can to help my grandma and grandpa.
I overhear a conversation from the dining room. The consideration of putting my grandpa in a care home occurs, but it did not happen. The process of dementia was slow yet fast. Through the tough times, good and bad. I realize the importance of caring for our elders and appreciating them. 

Later on, I find myself volunteering at two different facilities because of my grandpa and grandma. I want to share my profound passion of caring for people towards others. As well as what I learned from my grandfathers dementia, so I can share that experience and relate it to people struggling with the same disease themselves or different families that do not understand what it is like. Besides from my career goals in a health care setting, what is a better way than doing that through volunteering. 

The quality time I spent with my grandpa made me want to give some of my time to others who do not have a family to give them company that they deserve. 

My thoughts - explore two different types of facilities to experience health care of all ages. 

I love to work with children, I babysit, take care of my little cousins and have a lot of experience with kids. I apply at a BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver and start to volunteer in September 2015.The BCCH specializes in health care for patients from birth to age 16.  
I have never worked with adults/elders in a health care setting before and lack theexperience, so I apply at The Salvation Army, Buchanan Lodge through Fraser Health in New Wesminster. The Buchanan Lodge is a home that provides care to adults who can not physically take care of themselves. 

Both, which give me an important lesson and realization for others who need a little bit of extra speical care. 

At BCCH, I help with charity events and play with children. I try my best to make a positive environment for everyone, including staff. I walk into the hospital, go floor to floor. I carefully analyze my surroundings around me. I reflect on the sight of sad faces on multiple children and fear in their parents eyes. I think to myself, having a child in the hospital is not only stressful to the child but parent too. Let us not forget, there are many happy children and families here too. Espeically on floor three, where newborns are held. The excitment I see from new or experienced mothers and fathers is one of the best sights to see. I feel touched and captivated. The hospital is different because there are routating patients. I meet many children and learn new things every time I visit. With some of the kids who stay there a bit longer, I see a a miraculous amount of growth and development in a short period of time. 


It is summer time now. I struggle with the feeling of not wanting to volunteer today. It can be hard to find the time out of my day, but I remember the benefits I have that motivates me to keep coming back. 

Today, I volunteer at the Buchanan Lodge. I leave my house, it is a beauitful sunny day with just a few clouds in the sky. I walk for five minutes down the hill, then turn left, enter entrance. I press the security buttons to enter through the main door, sign my name in the volunteer book, and the receptionsist greets me. I walk to the elevator to go upstairs to meet someone special to my heart.

I built a relationship with a lady named Marley who I visit frequently. First I walk to her room, then wheel Marley outside to the gardens, the feel of warm sun on our skin is endearing, the smell of the garden's peonies and lilacs fill the air at the bench we sit at. She talks for hours about her life experiences and joy she has for baking delicious cakes and pastries. I can almost smell the cinnamon lingering in the air from her apple pie she chat about. I picture how would it taste and start to think of my grandma's mouthwatering apple pie. The thoughts of crisp chunks of apple, flaky crust and a scoop of vanilla ice cream float through my head as she speaks. I also can not forget that she is born in the year of 1942, which she tells me repeatedly. 

At the Buchanan Lodge, I assist activity programs, bingo, ice cream days, bake sales, lunch and dinner parties, escort residents and more. One of my favourite days here is tea time with the ladies at the cafe. I pour hot tea. Most of them like chamomille, jasmine or earl grey tea. I give them treats one at a time, while assessing their dietary needs. We listen and dance to old music. I also enjoy ice cream day. I scoop flavours of ice cream and add different toppings in each bowls for all guests in the home. The enjoy the taste of sprinkles, nuts, fresh berries, whip cream, caramel and chocolate sauce. By the end of the day, my back and neck is sore from bending and leaning over, but it is all worth it. I spend numerous hours at the facility. I am happy to be here and give my time to our community and the people who were once my age. 

I feel satisfied with myself and accomplished. I built a lot of warm friendships whom I connect with. I walk with them, wheel-chair them around the place. I listen to them talk, laugh, cry, and bicker, just like I did with my grandpa. The reminisent feeling of my grandpa remains. They are happy to see me. That makes me smile. I even met other volunteers and built a friendship with them too.

I learned things about myself, inhanced my social skills and learned interesting facts, ideas, aspirations from the patients too. I consider others opinions more now. 


I love volunteering at both places, but the sense of being at a care home because of my grandparents gives me extra pride. One thing I like to do while I volunteer at both places is ask them the simple question of how are you doing? And if they have any questions for me, to not be afraid to ask. Even if I can not answer them all, because sometimes being in a hospital or care home, I notice that the patients or residents do not always get the chance to discuss what is on their mind and how they are feeling. This builds confidence and a sense of being at home. I try to be open and honest. Having a friend in scary or difficult times can mean the world to someone, change someones perspective and I have first hand experienced it myself. Being a volunteer has its challenges, but it is extremely rewarding. 

I suggest that others consider volunteering too or to even give it a try. It is an experience and feeling that can not be replaced. It makes you feel good about yourself and is also a productive way to spend extra free time. 

I credit my grandpa and grandma who encouraged my passion for caring for people. The ability to express sympathy towards others needs and understand other peoples perspective. Seeing children, adults, families, friends smile and overcome challenging obstacles makes volunteering all worthwhile. The quality of life of residents and patients is important to me and I feel privledged to get to know all of the people I met. 

My volunteer experience has shown me that just by saying one nice thing or being with someone for five minutes, I can make someones day. These are life lessons that I will take with me to share with others. 

I observe the health care workers at both facilities. The doctors, nurses, pracitioners, physicians, therapist, volunteers etc., and establish their hardwork. I admire them and strive to continue down a health care career.  

Momentarily I wake up suddenly from a dream about my grandpa. I miss him dearly.
