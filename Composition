Composition 
This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a composition. The minimum length of your composition should be in the neighborhood of 2,000 words. You may write more than 2,000 words, if you like. There is no maximum. 
Your composition should be a nonfiction narrative on any topic you choose (your readings will be from many genres, but your writing will be nonfiction). The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your creativity. This is the hard part: deciding what to write about. You must decide; I won’t assign a topic for you. The first step in authentic creativity involves getting a bit uncomfortable, and this kind of freedom in an academic setting is usually uncomfortable. Stick with the discomfort until something happens. To ease your anxiety about topics, here is a short list of possibilities: 
A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 
A narrative about an aspect of your inner life (for example, your relationship to your own creativity, or your struggle with procrastination) 
A narrative about a particular subject of deep interest to you (for example, the mythologies of Egypt, or your passion for cooking) 
A collection of poems on a specific theme (for example, nature) 
You only need to choose one topic, and you should choose it within the first two weeks of the course. Then start writing about it (see below for how and where to do that). As a companion list to the one above, here is a short list of topics that I do not wish you to write about: 
Video games 
Zombies (or other post-apocalyptic themes) 
Movies, Manga, comics, or popular culture in general 
Trauma (your own personal trauma) 
Any subject that is challenging for you to talk about openly (such as trauma) is a subject you should not write about. On the other hand, powerful personal experiences (including traumas) are often the best subject for creativity, so please use your judgment in deciding how best to be expressive while at the same being emotionally safe. If you’re not sure, ask. 
If you want highly specific examples of the kinds of subjects you might write about, read the main course text, Grain of Truth, as well as the posts on the course website (you’re doing that anyway, right?).

A narrative that describes an experience that was meaningful to you (for example, a travel or childhood experience) 

Travelling/Sailboat experience/ pirates/ venice/ etc.

I do not remeber my surrondings, who I was with, where I was with, what I was doing. The moment I was born was also the moment my life would be filled with colour. 
Coming from a smalltown in Vietnam, my parents had one dream and that dream was to sail around the world. After six months old, away we left. It was my brother, mom, dad and myself.
As I cannot remember that much because I was so young, the times that I do remember when I was yearing around 4 and 5 were the most meaningful experiences in life. I learned a lot of life lessons and lessons about helping to work with my family on a boat.
